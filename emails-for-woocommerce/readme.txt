WooCommerce Send Emails allows you to preview and send any of the WooCommerce transactional emails.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Send Emails** enables the resending of any WooCommerce transactional emails that are sent automatically by WooCommerce when the order is created (when the customer checks-out). You can send to the original Order recipient, or any email address that you specify.

The plugin adds a new 'Send Emails' meta box to your WooCommerce order-edit page that you can use to either "Send" or "Preview" any email. These are both very useful for Shop Admins, to see what the Customer will see, or Designers/Developers, to see what the email looks like. When you send the email you will be given the choice of sending it to the order recipient, or to any email address that you chose.



Happy Conversions!

== Installation ==

1. Install either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Once the plugin is activated you will see the new 'Send Emails' meta-box on the WooCommerce > Order page.
1. Use the drop-down list to chose form all the transactional emails from your shop.
1. Choose to "Send" or "Preview" the chosen transactional email.
1. Please also be aware that there will be times where a 3rd party plugin emails cannot be previewed or sent as the plugin developer does not allow for this kind of after-order sending. Unfortunately this is not an issue we can solve.
1. Have fun Sending and Previewing your WooCommerce transactional emails. Enjoy!
